# goreddit

Simple command line application to search about topic in redit.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository in your go-work space, see [more](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)  on how to set-up go work-space. Then either you can install by running ` go install github.com/biranjan/reddit/getfromreddit ` Or you could possibly use without installing by simply using `go run main.go`

## Using the goreddit

Once you installed you can simply run `getfromreddit <Search word>`.  At the moment the search topic can be only one keyword.  For example `getfromreddit America `

## Credit

This project was just to learn Go. Most of the code came from this very good tutorial on getting started with [Go](https://github.com/nf/reddit).  I have added the capability to search topic by keyword unlike in original tutorial where it just search only one topic.

Any suggestion and improvement are warmly welcomed.
